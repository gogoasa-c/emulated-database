# Emulated Database

Emulated simplist database for storing books written entirely in unix shell script, running in the terminal, storing the data for the books in the [baza_date.txt](baza_date.txt) file.

## Functionality
The program allows for the user to add entries, view all of the entires, search for entries, update them, and delete them through the menu that presents the user with the 5 options upon running the script:
* Add 
* View 
* Search
* Update 
* Delete 

The Add, Search, Update, and Delete are all followed up by appropriate prompts for the user to respond to, such as when using the Add command, the user is prompted to give the book an ID, a name, an author, a publishing house, and a price. Afterwards, the user is asked if they would like to add any more items.
